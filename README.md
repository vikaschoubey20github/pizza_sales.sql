This project is about analyzing pizza sales data to gain insights and answer various questions related to the sales performance. The project covers a wide range of analysis levels, from basic to advanced, to cater to different information needs.

At the basic level, the project focuses on retrieving total orders, calculating total revenue, identifying the highest-priced pizza, determining the most common pizza size, and listing the top 5 most ordered pizza types.

Moving to the intermediate level, the project involves joining necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered, determining the distribution of orders by hour of the day, joining relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas, grouping orders by date and calculating the average number of pizzas ordered per day, and determining the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

Finally, at the advanced level, the project calculates the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue, analyzes the cumulative revenue generated over time, and determines the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.

In summary, this Pizza Sales Analysis Project aims to offer valuable insights into pizza sales data, helping stakeholders make informed decisions and optimize sales strategies.
